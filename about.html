    <h2>EARLY LIFE</h2>

    <br>Miguel was born to a Mexican-American father and African-American mother, his parents divorced when
    he was eight years old. After which, he and his brother lived primarily with his mother. Growing up
    Miguel listened to R&B, funk, hip hop, rock and jazz, mainly due to his parents' diverse taste in
    music. By the age of fourteen, he was writing and recording his own songs.</br>

    <br>In 2004 he was signed to independent record label Black Ice, he completed his first studio
    album, <i>Young & Free</i> in 2006. The label only released his single "Get Your Hands Up"
    from the album. With its poor release, Miguel left Black Ice, and has since said the experience
    taught him to take control of the way his music is marketed.</br>

    <br>In 2007, Miguel signed with Jive Records and released his next album <i>All I Want Is You.</i>
    However due to breach of contract with Black Ice, the album was not released for several years
    pending a lawsuit. November 2010 was the official release of the new album. Sales began slow
    but as the radio played singles "Quickie" and "Sure Thing," <i>All I Want Is You</i> eventually
    spent 45 weeks on the Billboard charts and sold more than 400,000 copies in the US.</br>
